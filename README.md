# Line-follower-bot
Arduino Code for PID Controlled Line follower bot


## Introduction
This bot was created by me and four other guys for a Line following bot competition in Srijan


## What does this bot do
The bot follows a black line. The objective is to start from one point and reach till end as fast as possible.

## Details of implementation
* We used Arduino Nano and L298N motor driver for our project.
* We used the Library L298N which can be downloaded arduino libraries in the application.
* Link of the github repo of L298N: https://github.com/AndreaLombardo/L298N
* Speciality of our bot is, it has the ability to self correct over compensating turns. We Achieve this by reversing the motor for a short duration so it comes back on track and runs again.
